# Calculator Testing Project
## I've created a simple calculator program, that will perform basic arithmetic operations, and I've done some basic unit testing on the core functions. 
## Core functions
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division (with zero division handling)
## Unit Testing
I did a test for each function to make sure they all work as expected. 
## Project Structure
- calculator.py -> contains the calculator functions
- test_calculator,py -> contains unit tests for all calculator's functions
## Run the project
The project can be run with this command: 
python -m unittest test_calculator.py
